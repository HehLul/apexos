          <h3>The Problem</h3>
          <p>
            High performers get stuck not because they lack drive, but because
            they lack data. You're making critical performance decisions based
            on gut feelings instead of objective metrics.

          <h3>The Realization</h3>
          <p>
            You know that gut feeling at day's endâ€”knowing you left potential in
            the tank. Without systematic tracking, you'll waste months fixing
            surface issues while real bottlenecks destroy your potential every
            hour.
